# About
I developed this project to tackle a common issue during the hot summer months of my home state Florida: ensuring you stay hydrated. So, I decided to program my own application for this purpose.

# Features
### Personalized Hydration Tracking

- The application greets you with a welcome screen that asks for your name and weight.
- This data will be useful in calculating the amount of water you will drink.

### Daily Water Intake Calculations

- The program then utilizes your inputed weight to calculate your daily water intake.
- This calculation is based on a Penn Medicine study, finding that you should drink about half your body weight in ounces per day. This is then converted to cups.

### Water Consumption Logging

- Users are then able to log their water consumption as the day progresses, with a percentage of daily goal meter.
- This motivates users to push forward and complete their goal.

### Reaching Daily Goal

- Once the user's daily goal is reached, they are congratulated and can navigate back to the main menu or view the leaderboard.

### Interactive Leaderboard

- This leaderboard serves to encourage users to beat their previous scores or continue their streak of reaching their goals.
